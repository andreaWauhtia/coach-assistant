## Notes & confidence
- These events were transcribed manually from the screenshots you attached. I assigned a per-event `confidence` field in the JSON; names / minutes with lower confidence should be double-checked.
- I assumed USAO U8 is the left-side team in the SportEasy screenshots (HOME). If USAO appears on the right in other captures, we should annotate `our-team` explicitly when parsing.

## Next steps
1. Confirm this draft JSON and the `match_summary` content.
2. I can run the parsing pipeline to produce a CSV (`parsed_by_side.csv`) and a formatted `rapport_analyse_complete.md` using templates if you want — tell me to proceed.
3. If you confirm, I can also copy the original screenshots into `.memory-bank/competitions/analysis/2025-10-11/raw/` for traceability (I currently have the transcriptions; please confirm you want me to save the images here).
