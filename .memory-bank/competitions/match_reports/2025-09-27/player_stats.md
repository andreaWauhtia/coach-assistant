**Interpretation & coaching notes**
- The scoring load is well-distributed but Auguste and Maxence carry the biggest share — reinforce rotations that free those players in scoring zones.
- Hugo and Lilou show involvement in both creation and finishing; Hugo should work on shot precision (2 misses recorded).
- Robin is an effective creator (2 assists) — consider training patterns to exploit his vision (1-2 combinations toward the right flank).

**Suggested micro-tasks for next training (short, actionable)**
- 10 min: Finishing under pressure — small-sided 2v1 finishing from short passes.
- 15 min: Quick one-two passing circuits with Robin and the creative players as focal points.
- 10 min: Guarding transitions — 4v3 → 3v4 exercises to reduce conceded counters.
